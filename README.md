  - proformance looks stupid
  - easily trapped in endless loop lyrics
  - not coherent, not logical
  - nearly no rhyme
- using data split (in ./data_split_bytone/)
  - proformance looks stupid as well
  - easily trapped in endless loop lyrics
  - looks logical in someway
  - rhyme the same with training data

## data_split_bytone
my exploring based on file "df_all_pinyin_clear.csv" provided by data-cleaning group

splitting data into several files, each file contains lyrics with the same tone

hope you find them useful
